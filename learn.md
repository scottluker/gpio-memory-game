- How to use the Python GPIO Zero library with buttons and LEDs.
- How to wire a circuit that includes a breadboard, LEDs, resistors, wires and buttons.
- How to create `functions`, `for loops` and `while loops` to repeat instructions in Python.
- How to use `global` and `local` variables within functions.
