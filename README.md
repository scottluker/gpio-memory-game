# GPIO Memory Game

In this project, you will create a memory game with your Raspberry Pi and a selection of electronic components. You will also be using the GPIO Zero library, which means you can easily control LEDs and detect button presses. By the end you will be able to challenge your friends to see who can get the highest score.

## Requirements

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

### Hardware

- 1 x Solderless breadboard
- 4 x Tactile push buttons
- 4 x LEDs
- 4 x 330 Ohm resistors
- 9 x Male-to-female jumper leads
- 8 x Male-to-male jumper leads

### Software

- GPIO Zero for Python 3

See [software installation](software.md)
