# GPIO Memory Game

Make your own memory game with your Raspberry Pi and some electronic components. Using buttons and LEDs is an easy way to get started with GPIO Zero and make your projects more interactive.

## Requirements

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

### Hardware

- 1 x Solderless breadboard
- 4 x Tactile push buttons
- 4 x LEDs
- 4 x 330 Ohm resistors
- 9 x Male-to-female jumper leads
- 8 x Male-to-male jumper leads

### Software

- GPIO Zero for Python 3
