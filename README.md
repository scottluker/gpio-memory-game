# GPIO Memory Game

![GPIO Memory Game](cover.png)

In this resource, you will create a memory game in Python with your Raspberry Pi and a selection of electronic components. You also will be using the GPIO Zero library, which means you can easily control the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins from your program to turn LEDs on or off and detect when a button has been pressed.

## Requirements

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card loaded with Raspbian, you'll also need:

### Hardware

- 1 x Solderless breadboard
- 4 x Tactile push buttons
- 4 x LEDs
- 4 x 330 Ohm resistors
- 9 x Male-to-female jumper leads
- 8 x Male-to-male jumper leads

### Software

- GPIO Zero for Python 3

See [software installation](software.md)
