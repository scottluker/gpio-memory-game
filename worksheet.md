# GPIO Memory Game

In this resource, you will create a memory game in Python with your Raspberry Pi and a selection of electronic components. You also will be using the GPIO Zero library, which means you can easily control the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins from your program to turn LEDs on or off and detect when a button has been pressed.

## Connecting The Components

To begin, you're going to connect all the components together with your Raspberry Pi.

1. Start by placing the buttons into your breadboard, as shown below:

2. Next, place the resistors

3. Now place the LEDs into your breadboard. As LEDs are a polarized component, you must make sure the long leg is placed...

4. Finally, add jumper leads to connect all the components to your Raspberry Pi.

## import modules / setup buttons and leds

## create pattern_generator() and play_pattern()

## create detect_input() and detect_pattern()

## combine code so far

## create game_setup()

## create game_menu()

## create game while loop

## complete code


## What's next?

-
- You could create an extra menu to change the round speed, difficulty and player's lives.
